VI. CONCLUSION
a. Summary
This study analyzed crime patterns in Washington, D.C., in 2024, focusing on crime distribution across neighborhoods, prevalent crime types, time-based patterns, and correlations. The findings reveal that crime is unevenly distributed across neighborhoods, with some areas experiencing significantly higher crime rates. The theft was the most frequently reported crime, while homicide and assault were more common during the midnight shift. The time-based pattern indicated that September recorded the highest number of incidents, while March had the lowest. A statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation between crime type and time of day, reinforcing the importance of time-sensitive law enforcement strategies.
b. Future Directions
Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating socioeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, education levels, and income disparities to understand crime patterns more deeply. Additionally, machine learning models and linear regression analysis for predictive crime modeling could help forecast potential crime hotspots and uncover the influence of continuous predictors like time, population density, or resource allocation. Longitudinal studies analyzing crime trends over multiple years would provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of policy changes and law enforcement interventions.
